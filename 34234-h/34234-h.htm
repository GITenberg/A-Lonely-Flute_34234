The vague, deep-mouthed commotion<BR>

LAUS MARIÆ<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
There is a name like some deep melody<BR>
Hallowed by sundown, delicate as the plash<BR>
Of lonely waves on solitary lakes<BR>
And rounded as the sudden-bursting bloom<BR>
Of bold, deep-throated notes in a midnight cloud<BR>
When shadowy belfries far away roll out<BR>
Across the dark their avalanche of sound.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
It is a wild voice lost in the wail of the wind;<BR>
The silvery-twinkling plectrum of the rain<BR>
Plays in the poplar tree no other tune<BR>
And pines intone it softly as a prayer<BR>
In leafy litanies.<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 5em">The name is raised</SPAN><BR>
Even to God's ear from ancient arches dim<BR>
With caverned twilight and dull altar smoke<BR>
Where tapers weave athwart the azure haze<BR>
Innumerable pageantries of dusk.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Low-voiced and soft-eyed women must they live<BR>
Who bear that holy name.  And now for one<BR>
Time has no other honor than to be<BR>
The meaning of an unremembered rhyme,<BR>
The breath of a forgotten singer's song.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
I must forget awhile the mellow flutes<BR>
And all the lyric wizardry of strings;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The fragile clarinet,</SPAN><BR>
Tremulous over meadows rich with dawn,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Must knock against my vagrant heart</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And throb and cry no more.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For I am shaken by the loveliness<BR>
And lights and laughter and beguiling song<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Of all this siren world;</SPAN><BR>
The regal beauty of women, round on round,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The swift, lithe slenderness of girls,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And children's loyal eyes,</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Hill rivers and the lilac fringe of seas<BR>
Lazily plunging, glow of city nights<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And faces in the glow&mdash;</SPAN><BR>
These things have stolen my heart away, I lie<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Parcelled abroad in sound and hue,</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Dispersed through all I love.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I must go far away to a still place<BR>
And draw the shadows down across my eyes<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And wait and listen there</SPAN><BR>
For wings vibrating from beyond the stars,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Wide-ranging, swiftly winnowing wings</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Bearing me back mine own.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So soon, now, I shall lie deep hidden away<BR>
From sound or sight, with hearing strangely dull<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And heavy-lidded eyes,&mdash;</SPAN><BR>
'T is time, O passionate soul, for me to go<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Some far, hill-folded road apart</SPAN><BR>

Beneath the gradual host<BR>

Slowly she cometh on<BR>

From what far-lying land<BR>

Dim ship?  And what mysterious hand<BR>

A BALLAD OF LOVE AND DEATH<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
She winded on the castle horn,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">She clamored long and bold,</SPAN><BR>
For she was way-spent and forlorn<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And she was sore a-cold.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And she stood lonely in the snow.<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Vague quiet filled the air....</SPAN><BR>
From heaven's roof looked down aloof<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The stars, with steady stare.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
She heard the droning drift of snow<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And the wolf-wind on the hill....</SPAN><BR>
No other sound....  For leagues around<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The night was very still.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
She cried aloud in sudden fright,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">"Open!  Warder ho!</SPAN><BR>
Here is a pilgrim guest to-night<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Who can no farther go."</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The steady beat of mailed feet<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">In angry answer rang</SPAN><BR>
Along the floor.  The castle door<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Gave in with iron clang</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And the warder strode into his tower<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And saw her standing there</SPAN><BR>
Weary, like a storm-tossed flower,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And, like an angel, fair.</SPAN><BR>

"Here is no lodging for the night,<BR>

Unearthly, dark, nocturnal things<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">With faint and furtive stir</SPAN><BR>

As she made answer wearily:<BR>

"Yea, though I came through flood and flame,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Through tempest, flood, and fire,</SPAN><BR>

"And though I prayed the stars for aid<BR>

"Aye, though my feet have been thus fleet,<BR>

Whose sleep is still beneath the hill,<BR>

And he bent gently down above,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">A soft light in his eye...</SPAN><BR>

"But thou, Love, who canst tread the stars,<BR>

But Love made answer, and her voice<BR>

  WASTE
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Reluctant, groping fog crept gray and cold<BR>
Up from the fields where now the guns were still;<BR>
Far off the thundering surge of battle rolled<BR>
And darkness brooded on the quiet hill;<BR>
Clearly, across the listening night, the shrill<BR>
And rhythmic cry of a lonely cricket fell<BR>
On ears long deafened by the scream of shot and shell.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And there were two who listened wistfully<BR>
To that glad voice, that sad last voice of all,<BR>
Who on the morrow after reveille<BR>
Would make no answer to the muster call;<BR>
Others would eat their mess, others would fall<BR>
When the lines formed again into their places,<BR>
And soon their marching comrades would forget their faces.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
One moaned a little and the other turned<BR>
Painfully sidewise, peering up the bare<BR>
Shell-furrowed slope.  Then, while his deep wound burned,<BR>
He crawled, slow inch by weary inch, to where<BR>
The boy lay,&mdash;young, he thought, and strangely fair.<BR>
"You see, I came," he said.  "It was a wrench.<BR>
I thought I'd die.  Let's have a light here.  What!  You're French!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"No matter ... we'll be going pretty soon...<BR>
Dying 's a lonesome business at the best,<BR>
And when there's nothing but a ghastly moon<BR>
And fog for company, I lose my zest.<BR>
There's a girl somewhere ... well... you know the rest.<BR>
I'm glad I came.  It's hand in hand now, brother.<BR>
I think I laid you here.  I wish 't had been another.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"I never meant it, and you did n't mean<BR>
For me this ugly gash along my side.<BR>
Something has pushed us on.  Our slate is clean.<BR>
And long and long after we two have died<BR>
Some learnedest of doctors will decide<BR>
What thing it was.  But we ... we'll never know.<BR>
Our business now 's to help make next year's harvest grow.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
"You've been at school?  College de France!  You know<BR>
Next year I should have heard your Bergson there,&mdash;<BR>
Greatest since Hegel.  Think of Haeckel, though,<BR>
At my own Jena!  Mighty men they were.<BR>
Not mighty enough for what they had to bear.<BR>
They read and wrote and taught, but you and I,<BR>
How have we profited at last?  Well, here we lie.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"If I had known you by the silver Rhine,<BR>
That dreamy country where I had my birth,<BR>
The land of golden corn and golden wine<BR>
And surely, I think, the world's most lovely earth,&mdash;<BR>
I should have loved you, brother, and known your worth.<BR>
But you were born beside the racing Rhone.<BR>
Ah, yes, that made the difference.  That thing alone.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"We might have fronted this world's stormy weather<BR>
Hand clasped in hand and seeing eye to eye.<BR>
What was there we could not have done together?<BR>
Who dares to say we should have feared to die,<BR>
Shoulder to shoulder standing, you and I?<BR>
But now you are slain by me, your unknown friend.<BR>
I die by your unknowing hand.  This ... this is the end!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"And all the love that might have been is blown<BR>
Far off like clouds that fade across the blue;<BR>
The game is over and the night shuts down,<BR>
Blotting the little dreams of me and you<BR>
And all our hope of all we longed to do.<BR>
But courage, comrade!  It's not hard to die.<BR>
It's not so lonely now.  If only we know why!"<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The fog-damp folded closer round the hill<BR>
And stillness deepened, but the cricket's song<BR>
Tore at the heavy hem of silence still&mdash;<BR>
One small voice left of love in a world of wrong.<BR>
A few dim stars looked down.  The yelling throng<BR>
Of guns had passed beyond the mountain's brow<BR>
When once again he spoke, but slowly, faintlier now.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Something discovered that it didn't need us&mdash;<BR>
Me in the Fatherland and you in France.<BR>
We were less worth than what it took to feed us,<BR>
And so life gave us only a little glance.<BR>
It's true to say we never had a chance.<BR>
It's like this fog, around, above, below.<BR>
Reach out your hand to me.  Good-night.  We'll never know."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And then they lay so still they seemed asleep,<BR>
For death was near and they had little pain.<BR>
The midnight did not hear them moan or weep<BR>
For life and love and gladness lost in vain<BR>
And faces they would never see again,&mdash;<BR>
Old friends, old lovers.  All seemed at a distance.<BR>
The minutes crept and crept.  They made no strong resistance.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
They only lay and looked up at the stars,<BR>
Feeling they had not known how fair they were.<BR>
I think their hearts were far from those loud wars<BR>
As they lay listening to the cricket's chirr<BR>
Until it faded to a drowsy blur,<BR>
Dwindled, and died, lost in the distant roar<BR>
Of waves that plunged and broke on some eternal shore.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
She has grown pale and spectral with our wounds<BR>
And she is worn with memories of woe<BR>
Older than Karnak.  Multitudinous feet<BR>
Of all the phantom armies of the world<BR>
Resounding down the hollow halls of time,<BR>
Have kept their far-off rumor in her ear.<BR>
For she was old when Nineveh and Tyre<BR>
And Baalbec of the waste went down in blood;<BR>
Pompey and Tamburlaine and Genghis Khan<BR>
Are dreams of only yesternight to her.<BR>
And still she keeps, chained to a loathsome thing,<BR>
Her straining, distant paces up and down<BR>
The vaulted cell, but wistful of an end<BR>
When all our swarm of shuddering life shall drop<BR>
Like some dead cooling cinder down the void,<BR>
Leaving her clean, in blessed barrenness.<BR>

There where he sits in the cold, in the gloom,<BR>
Of his far-away place by his thundering loom,<BR>
He weaves on the shuttles of day and of night<BR>

He has wrought him a glimmering garment to fling<BR>
Over the sweet swift limbs of the Spring,<BR>

Where the rivulet swept by a sycamore root<BR>
With a turbulent voice and a hurrying foot,<BR>
I bent by the water and spoke in my dream<BR>
To the wavering, restless, unlingering stream:<BR>
"Oh, turbulent rivulet hastening past,<BR>
For what wonderful goal do you hope at the last<BR>
That never you pause in the shimmering green<BR>
Of the undulant shade where the sycamores lean<BR>
Or rest in the moss-curtained, cool dripping halls<BR>
Hidden under the veils of your musical falls<BR>
Or loiter at peace by the tremulous fern&mdash;<BR>
White wandering waters that never return?"<BR>

And I dreamed by the rivulet's wavering side<BR>
That a myriad ripple of voices replied:<BR>
"Aloft on the mountain, afar on the steep,<BR>
A voice that we knew cried aloud in our sleep,<BR>
'Come, hasten ye down to the vale and to me,<BR>
Your begetter, destroyer, preserver, the Sea!'<BR>
We must carry our feebleness down to the Strong,<BR>
We must mingle us deep in the Whole, and ere long<BR>
All the numberless host of the heaven shall ride<BR>
With the pale Lady Moon on our slumbering tide."<BR>

THE FIRST CHRISTIAN<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
A little wandering wind went up the hill.<BR>
It had a lonely voice as though it knew<BR>
What it should find before it came to where<BR>
The broken body of him that had been Christ<BR>
Hung in the ruddy glow.  A bowshot down<BR>
The bleak rock-shouldered hill the soldiery<BR>
Had piled a fire, and when the searching wind<BR>
Came stronger from the distant sea and dashed<BR>
The shadows and the gleam together, songs<BR>
Of battle and lust were blown along the slope<BR>
Mingled with clash of swords on cuisse and shield.<BR>
But of the women sitting by the cross<BR>
Even she whose life had been as gravely sweet<BR>
And sheltered as a lily's did not flinch.<BR>
Her face was buried in her shrouding cloak.<BR>
And she who knew too sorrowfully well<BR>
The cruelty and bitterness of life<BR>
Heard not.  She sat erect, her shadowy hair<BR>
Blown back along the darkness and her eyes<BR>
That searched the distant spaces of the night<BR>
Splendid and glowing with an inward joy.<BR>
And at the darkest hour came three or four<BR>
From round the fire and would have driven them thence;<BR>
But one who knew them, gazing in their eyes,<BR>
Said: "Nay.  It is his mother and his love,<BR>
The scarlet Magdalena.  Let them be."<BR>
So, in the gloom beside that glimmering cross,<BR>
Beneath the broken body of him they loved,<BR>
They wept and watched&mdash;the lily and the rose.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
At last the deep, low voice of Magdalen,<BR>
Toned like a distant bell, broke on the hush:<BR>
"We are so weak!  What can poor women do?<BR>
So pitifully frail!  God pity us!<BR>
How he did pity us!  He understood...<BR>
Out of his own great strength he understood<BR>
How it might feel to be so very weak...<BR>
To be a tender lily of the field,<BR>
To be a lamb lost in the windy hills<BR>
Far from the fold and from the shepherd's voice,<BR>
To be a child with no strength, only love.<BR>
And ah, he knew, if ever a man can know,<BR>
What 't is to be a woman and to live,<BR>
Strive how she may to out-soar and overcome,<BR>
Tied to this too frail body of too fair earth!<BR>

"Oh, had I been a man to shield him then<BR>

And yet, a man's strength with a woman's love...<BR>
That might have served him somewhat ere the end."<BR>

Then with a weary voice the mother said:<BR>

That strong men strive for he passed heedless by.<BR>
Because that he was weak I loved him so...<BR>
For that and for his soft and gentle ways,<BR>
The tender patient calling of his voice<BR>

He was so good a workman ... axe and saw<BR>

In golden glory on the boy's bright hair<BR>
And on the shavings that were golden too.<BR>

Before the years of doubt and trouble came.<BR>
Then, while loud laughter sounded up the hill<BR>
Where yet that ribald crew sang o'er the wine,<BR>

Knowing almighty hands were stretched to snatch<BR>
And lift thee from the greedy clutching grave.<BR>
Falsely!  Forgetting dark Gethsemane,&mdash;<BR>
Not knowing, as I know, what doubt assailed<BR>
Thy human heart until the latest breath.<BR>
Ah, what a trumpery death, what mockery<BR>
And mere theatric mimicry of pain,<BR>
If thou didst surely know thou couldst not die!<BR>
Thou didst not know.  And whether even now<BR>
Thy straying ghost, like some great moth of night<BR>
Blown seaward through the shadow, flies and drifts<BR>
Along dim coasts and headlands of the dark,<BR>
A homeless wanderer up and down the void,<BR>
Or whether indeed thou art enthroned above<BR>
In light and life, I know not.  This I know&mdash;<BR>
That in the moment of sheer certainty<BR>
My soul will die.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 7em">"No!  On thy spirit lay</SPAN><BR>
All the dark weight and mystery of pain<BR>
And all our human doubt and flickering hope,<BR>
Deathless despairs and treasuries of tears,<BR>
Gropings of spirit blindfold by the flesh<BR>
And grapplings with the fiend.  Else were thy death<BR>
Less like a God's than even mine may be.<BR>

"Thou broken mother who canst see in him<BR>
Only the quiet man, the needful child,<BR>
And most of all the Babe of Bethlehem,<BR>
Let it suffice thee.  Thy reward is great.<BR>
Who loveth God that never hath loved man?<BR>
Who knoweth man but cometh to know God?<BR>
Thou sacred, sorrowing mother, canst thou learn&mdash;<BR>
Thou who hast gone so softly in God's sight&mdash;<BR>
Of me, the scarlet woman of old days?<BR>
Come, let us talk together, thou and I.<BR>
Apart, we see him darkly, through a glass;<BR>
Together, we shall surely see aright.<BR>
Bring thou thine innocence, thy stainless soul,<BR>
And I will bring deep lore of suffering,<BR>
My dear-bought wisdom of defeat and pain.<BR>
For out of these may come, believe it thou,<BR>
Sanctities not like thine, but fit to bear<BR>
The bitter storms and whirlwinds of this world.<BR>
Aye, out of evil often springeth good,<BR>
And sweetest honey from the lion's mouth.<BR>
And that he knew.  That very thing he meant<BR>
When he withdrew me from the pits of shame.<BR>
'T is I who see God shining through the man.<BR>
I see the deity, the godlike strength<BR>
In his supreme capacity for pain.<BR>
Nor have I known the cruel love of men<BR>
These many years to err when now I say<BR>
This man loved not like men but like a God.<BR>
Thou broken mother, weep not for the child,<BR>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
